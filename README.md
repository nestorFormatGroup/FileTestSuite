# FileTestSuite
Collection of files to test tools

For the files in this repository the following conditions are true:

* the data producer who contribute the files has all rights, there are no copyright or other legal problems with the content of the files
* the files mostly were contributed by working group members, friends, workmates and family


Some information about the files

File with the name "zahl" and the ".aw"-Extension (in zip "Office_Files_1990s")
* last edited: 23rd August 2003
* Format: Applix Words (application/x-applix-word)
* PUID: most likey x-fmt/326
* still renderable? Yes, with KDE Calligra Suite
* contributed by: Susanne Holl (Nachlass Friedrich Kittler)
* remarks: LibMagic (File) presumes .aw files to be "text/html", which is not correct,GVFSInfo marks them as "application/x-applix-word". PRONOM marks .aw files as x-fmt/326, "Hewlett Packard AdvanceWrite Text File" (might be the same?)

File with the name "hirdina" and the ".kw"-Extension (in zip "Office_Files_1990s")

Remark about file "Geburtstage":
* These are not real persons with their real birthdays. It was an example during a school lesson only.


Test in january 2017
Sigfried has an idea about the file format for all files except for:
riceflÃ¤ch.dot'
GS8_ZWKR.TXT'
KRETA.TXT'

For riceflÃ¤ch.dot' TRId and File Utility do not have any ideas, either and the file is supposedly empty. It has 0 kb and seems to be indeed empty.
